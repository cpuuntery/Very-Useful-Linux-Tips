Find Command searches for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on a user given expression and can perform a user-specified action on each matched file

find [path...] [options] [expression]

. Is the current directory

GNU find path is optional. If it is not specified, find will use the current directory that it is invoked from as a path.

If type in not specified, find will search for both files and directories
If name is not specified, find will search for every thing. Files and directories and the content of subdirectories and will return every thing that exist under the search path.

-type f to search only of files 
-type d to search only of directories 
-name to search for file or directory by name. Wildcard is supported. (case-sensitive)  
-iname is case-insensitive. Wildcard is supported 
-exec will run the command. From the working directory, that the find command invoked from.
-execdir command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file

if you use -exec or -execdir you must added {} \; or {} \+ after it 
{} \; the command will be executed on each matched file
{} \+ each matched file will be passed as arguments to your single command.

Examples

#Execute every sh file by the name generate.mp3.sh
find -type f -iname "*.sh" -execdir sh generate.mp3.sh {} \;

#Copy file to every directory and subdirectory
find /home/yousif/Desktop/Webtoon-Downloader-master/src/If_AI_Ruled_the_World -type d -exec cp /home/yousif/Videos/your_thron.html {} \;

#If you want to exclude parent directory use -mindepth 1
find /home/yousif/Desktop/Webtoon-Downloader-master/src/If_AI_Ruled_the_World -mindepth 1 -type d -exec cp /home/yousif/Videos/your_thron.html {} \;

if find return an unordered list of files. 
you can fix the ordering of the list like this example

find -type f -printf "%f\n" 

OR

find -type f | sed -e 's/\/.*\///g' -e 's/^\.//g' -e 's/^\///g'

#Rename both files and directories recursively
find -execdir rename 's/find/replace/g' {} +

#Rename only files recursively
find -type f -execdir rename 's/find/replace/g' {} +

#Rename only directories recursively
find -type d -execdir rename 's/find/replace/g' {} +
