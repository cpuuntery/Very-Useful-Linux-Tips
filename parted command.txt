this works in linux vm
parted /dev/sdX   use full disk and not the partition number
(parted) unit B
(parted) print free
(parted) resizepart [partition_number] 
(parted) [put the end value of the Free Space]
resize2fs /dev/sdX

or you could use
parted /dev/sdx print free
(parted) mkpart # you can use the start and the end from the print free command


Deleting a Partition
parted /dev/sdx
(parted) print free
(parted) rm [partition_number]


Growing partition if the unallocated space is after the partition
parted /dev/sdx

(parted) unit B
(parted) print free
(parted) resizepart [partition_number]  #use the start and the end from the print free command
(parted) mkpart # you can use the start and the end from the print free command


if the unallocated space is before the partition your only option us to remove the partition then the unallocated space will be merged then create a new partition
parted /dev/sdx

(parted) unit B
(parted) print free
(parted) rm [partition_number]
(parted) mkpart

or
you could format the partition to get the extended size 
# mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sdX

or

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX
