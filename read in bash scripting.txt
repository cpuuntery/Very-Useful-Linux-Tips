In bash scripting read is very bizarre and odd for me, 
take this as an example

pm list packages | sed 's/package://g' | while read line; do [[ `dumpsys package $line | grep 'android.permission.INTERNET'` ]] && echo "$line"; done

the last line does not need explaining because echo return the value of the variable to the shell and done marks the end of the loop

the first part will be pumped into the variable 

sed 's/package://g' | while read line

the second part, execute something for every line read from the variable

read line; do [[ `dumpsys package $line | grep 'android.permission.INTERNET'` ]]

here is another example

read -p "Enter a word: " word
echo "You entered $word"
