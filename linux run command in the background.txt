nohup command &
setsid command &
command & disown               [disown must always be the at the end and there must not be anything after it]
systemd-run --user command     [stop any output from the command, so there is no need to use {&>/dev/null &} but you also can not log anything even if you wanted to]



examples
nohup ./http-file-server &> log.txt
setsid ./http-file-server &> log.txt
./http-file-server &> log.txt & disown
systemd-run --user ./http-file-server



command &>/dev/null &
It will not make the command run in background, 
it will just make any and all output of the command will be sent to dev/null 
and since that is the only effect, closing the shell will kill the command 


Aside from nohup and systemd the other ways keep the command output visible, but there is a difference between nohup sends the output to nohup.out but systemd stop it completely
So if combined [&>/dev/null &] with these three ways, you can both run the command in the background and get rid of the output if that is what you want


nohup command &>/dev/null &
setsid command &>/dev/null &
command &>/dev/null & disown



examples
nohup ./http-file-server &>/dev/null &
setsid ./http-file-server &>/dev/null &
./http-file-server &>/dev/null & disown
