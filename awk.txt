The day has come and I learned something about awk 
for now, I think it is useful to filter output based on a condition
and you can pipe awk into another awk
the Syntax is like this 
awk 'the condition {print}'
let me explain this command

find . -type f -iname "*.*"  -exec file {} \; | sed -E 's/(.*): [A-Z].*, ([0-9].*x.*[0-9]+),.*/\2 \1/' | awk 'int($1) == 48 {print}' | awk -F 'x' 'int($2) == 48 {print}'

int($1) means look for integers and assign them to $1
it can include any number of integers, the stopping point is when something is not an integer is found
100 is 100 and not [1,0,0]
{print} means only the input that satisfy the condition is returned
in the second awk 
-F mean to delimit 'x' as a separator 
for example
100x120 will be 100 as the first integer aka $1
200 will be the second integer, aka $2
without -F flag $2 will be meaningless
