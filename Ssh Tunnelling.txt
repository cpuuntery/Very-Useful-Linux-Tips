#Reverse ssh tunnelling

ssh -p port -f -N -T -R the-ip-that-the-server-can-access:port:the-ip-that-the-client-can-access:port username@ssh-server-address


example 

ssh -p 59080 -f -N -T -R 0.0.0.0:3000:localhost:3000 cabox@host22.codeanyhost.com

# -p is used because the codeanyhost.com server does not use port 22 (and in other words if you are not using the standard port).
Both the normal tunnelling and the reverse tunnelling are to be used on ssh client.
You need to configure the ssh server in the case of reverse tunnel.
It called reverse because the client act like server for the server and the server act like a client to the client.
If you write a port without the address, ssh will assume you mean localhost aka 127.0.0.1
Use this one to allow the server to access something the client is able to access


#Normal ssh tunnelling


ssh -p port -f -N -T -L the-ip-that-the-client-can-access:port:the-ip-that-the-server-can-access:port username@sshserveraddress



example

ssh -p port -f -N -T -L 1194:the-ip-that-the-server-can-access:port username@sshserveraddress

# use (-p) if you are using a non-standard port. But if you use the standard 22, then you don't need this parameter.
