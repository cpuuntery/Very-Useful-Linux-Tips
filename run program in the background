if you need to run a program, and you are not interested in its output, you should use
[program] > /dev/null 2>&1 & 
OR
[program] &>/dev/null &
and if you want to run more than one program, you can add the other program in a new line in the bash script
[program] > /dev/null 2>&1 & 
[program2] > /dev/null 2>&1 &
