# back up original
cp disk.img disk.img.bak

# append the old content just after the newly written bytes
in other words you use this if have a gpt header and you want to write the partitions after the gpt header because count overwrite and just stop at the stopping point
you want to use this when the disk image does not have the main gpt header [the one at the very start]

dd if=disk.img.missing_gpt_header of=disk.img_with_gpt_header bs=1 seek=16896 conv=notrunc


or
write the append as a file
dd if=/dev/sda of=disk.img bs=1 count=16896
then use seek to start wrting after the append
dd if=/dev/sda of=disk.img seek=33 skip=$((skip * 2)) count=$(((block_count + 1) * 2)) conv=notrunc status=progress

seek skips n blocks from the beginning of the output file.

skip skips n blocks from the beginning of the input file.
